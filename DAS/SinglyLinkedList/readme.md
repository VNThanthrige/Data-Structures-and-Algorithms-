### Singly Linked List
A linear data structure where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
Unlike arrays, elements are **not stored contiguously**, allowing dynamic memory allocation.

**Key Concepts**
- Pointer based traversal
- Dynamic memory usage
- One directional navigation 

**Common Use Cases**
- Implementing stacks and queues
- Dynamic data storage
- Used in many advanced structures in CS
