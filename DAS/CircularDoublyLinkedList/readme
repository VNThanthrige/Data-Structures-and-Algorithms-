# Circular Doubly Linked List

• A variant of the doubly linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This allows continuous traversal in both directions without a defined start or end.

Key Concepts

     ‣Circular linking (last node → first node)
     ‣Bidirectional traversal
     ‣Efficient insertions and deletions at both ends

## Common Use Cases

Multiplayer board games (turn-based logic)
Round-robin scheduling
Music or media playlists
