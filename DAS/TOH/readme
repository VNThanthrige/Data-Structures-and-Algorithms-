# Tower of Hanoi

This repository contains a **recursive implementation** of the Tower of Hanoi problem in Java.  

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science that demonstrates **recursion** and **problem-solving techniques**.

##  Problem Description

You have three rods and `n` disks of different sizes:  
- All disks start on the **source rod**, stacked largest to smallest.  
- The goal is to move all disks to the **destination rod** following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod.  
3. An auxiliary rod can be used as temporary storage.

## Characteristics

- **Recursive algorithm**  
- Demonstrates **divide and conquer** approach  
- Grows **exponentially** with the number of disks  


## Applications

- Teaching recursion and algorithm design  
- Puzzle-solving exercises  
- Understanding exponential growth and recursion stack
