# Insertion Sort (Java)

•This repository contains an implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm in Java.  
•Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position relative to previously sorted elements.

The algorithm works by:
1. Taking the next element (`key`)
2. Shifting larger elements to the right
3. Inserting the `key` into its sorted position



##  Characteristics

- **Stable** (preserves ordering of equal elements)
- **In place**
- Efficient for **small** or **nearly sorted** datasets
- Commonly used in:
  - Online sorting
  - Sorting incoming streams
  - Educational demonstrations of sorting 


##  When to Use Insertion Sort?

Use when:
- Data is almost sorted
- Input size is small 
- You need a stable sort
- You are streaming/inserting in sorted order

Avoid when:
- Large datasets or performance critical use cases
