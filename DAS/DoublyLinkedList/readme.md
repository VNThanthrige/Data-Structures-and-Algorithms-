### Doubly Linked List
An extension of the singly linked list where each node maintains references to both the previous and next nodes.

This enables **bidirectional traversal** and more efficient insertions and deletions.

**Key Concepts**
- Forward and backward traversal
- Efficient node removal
- Two way linking

**Common Use Cases**
- Undo or Redo operations (Browser navigations)
- Navigation systems
- Memory management and caching
