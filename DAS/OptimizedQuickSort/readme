# Optimized QuickSort

This repository contains an implementation of an **Optimized QuickSort** algorithm in Java.  
Optimized QuickSort is an enhanced version of the classic QuickSort, designed to improve performance by reducing worst case scenarios and speeding up small subarray sorting.

---

## How It Works

Optimized QuickSort works by:

1. **Selecting a pivot** using the **median of three method** (first, middle, last elements).  
2. **Partitioning** the array: elements less than the pivot go left, elements greater go right.  
3. **Recursively sorting** the left and right partitions.  
4. **Switching to Insertion Sort** for small subarrays (size ≤ 10) for efficiency.

These enhancements make it faster and more stable on real world datasets compared to plain QuickSort.


## Characteristics

✔ Divide and Conquer sorting algorithm  
✔ Inplace sorting (minimal extra memory)  
✔ Reduces likelihood of worst-case performance


## When to Use

Use when:

✔ Large datasets need efficient sorting  
✔ Predictable performance is desired  
✔ In-place sorting is required  

Avoid when:

✔ Small datasets (Insertion Sort alone may be faster)  
✔ Stable sort is required (Optimized QuickSort is **not stable**)
