# Selection Sort (Java)

This repository contains a Java implementation of the **Selection Sort** algorithm.  
Selection Sort repeatedly selects the **minimum element** from the unsorted portion of the array and moves it into its final position.


##  How It Works

Selection Sort performs the following steps:

1. Scan the array to find the **minimum** element
2. Swap it with the first unsorted element
3. Move the boundary of sorted/unsorted regions
4. Repeat until fully sorted


##  Characteristics

- **In place sorting**
- **Not stable** (relative order may break)
- Always performs the same number of comparisons (`O(n²)`)
- Useful when:
  ✔ memory is limited  
  ✔ swaps are costly but comparisons are cheap  



##  When To Use Selection Sort?

✔ Works for small datasets  
✔ Works when minimizing writes is important (at most `n` swaps)

Avoid when:
 input size is large  
 better time complexity is needed
