# Optimized Bubble Sort 

This repository contains an implementation of the **Optimized Bubble Sort** algorithm in Java.  
Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
This **optimized version** improves performance by stopping early when the array is already sorted.


##  How It Works

- Uses nested loops for comparisons
- Swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
- Adds a **swapped flag** to detect if the array is already sorted
- Stops the algorithm early if no swaps occurred in a pass

##  Characteristics

- **Stable** sorting algorithm  
- **In place** sorting  
- Optimized for **nearly sorted arrays**  
- Simple, but not efficient for large datasets  


##  When to Use Optimized Bubble Sort?

- Teaching sorting algorithms  
- Small or nearly sorted datasets  
- Demonstrating algorithm optimization  

Avoid for:
- Large datasets  
- Performance critical applications
