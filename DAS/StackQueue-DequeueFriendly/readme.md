### StackQueue — Dequeue Friendly
A queue implemented using two stacks, optimized so that dequeue operations are efficient.

This approach preserves **FIFO (First In First Out)** behavior while leveraging the **LIFO (Last In First Out)** nature of stacks.  
All reordering is handled during insertion, allowing constant-time removal.

**Key Concepts**
- Stack-based queue simulation
- Trade-off between enqueue and dequeue performance
- FIFO behavior using LIFO structures

# Common Use Cases
- Systems where fast removal is required
