# Quick Sort (Java)

This repository contains an implementation of the **Quick Sort** algorithm in Java.  
Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that utilizes a **Divide and Conquer** approach and is widely used in real-world systems due to its excellent average performance.

---

##  How It Works

Quick Sort works in three main steps:

1. Choose a **pivot** element
2. **Partition** the array into two halves:
   - Smaller elements on the left
   - Greater elements on the right
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to both halves

For this implementation, the **last element** is chosen as the pivot using the **Lomuto partition scheme**.

##  Characteristics

- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Not stable** (relative order not preserved)
- **In place sorting** (no extra arrays needed)
- Often faster than Merge Sort in practice
- Used in many real world libraries


##  When To Use Quick Sort?

Use when:

✔ Fast average performance needed  
✔ Memory usage should be minimal  
✔ Input data is arbitrary and not nearly sorted  

Avoid:

 When data is nearly sorted (can degrade to worst case)  
 When stability is required
