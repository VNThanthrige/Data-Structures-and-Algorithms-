# Queue Implementations

•This folder contains queue implementations written in Java.The goal is to understand how queues work and how they can be implemented using stacks.

    ‣QueueUsingStacksPushFriendly**
        A queue made using two stacks
        Adding elements is straightforward
        Removing elements may require moving data between stacks

    ‣QueueUsingStacksPopFriendly**
        Another queue using two stacks
        Removing elements is quick
        Adding elements needs some rearranging

## Why this exists
    To understand the FIFO (First In First Out) concept
    To explore different ways of building queues
    For academic learning and future reference
