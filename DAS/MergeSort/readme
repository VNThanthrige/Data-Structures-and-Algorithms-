# Merge Sort 

This repository contains an implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm in Java.  
Merge Sort is a classic example of a **Divide and Conquer** sorting algorithm and is widely used due to its predictable `O(n log n)` time complexity.


##  How It Works

Merge Sort operates in two main steps:

1. **Divide** the array into two halves recursively.
2. **Merge** the sorted halves back together.


##  Characteristics

- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Stable sort**
- **Not in place** (requires additional storage)
- Works well for large datasets
- Predictable performance regardless of initial ordering


##  When to Use Merge Sort?

Use when -

✔ Data sets are large  
✔ Stable sorting is needed  
✔ Predictable performance is important  

Avoid when:

✔ Memory usage is a constraint (extra space needed)
