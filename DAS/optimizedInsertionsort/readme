# Optimized Insertion Sort 

This repository contains an optimized implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm in Java.  
Insertion Sort builds a sorted portion of the array one element at a time.  
This optimized version improves performance by shifting elements instead of swapping repeatedly.


##  How It Works

For each element:
1. Store the value as `key`
2. Shift all larger elements one position to the right
3. Insert the `key` in its correct position



##  Characteristics

- **Stable sorting**
- **In place (no extra memory)**
- Efficient for -
   small datasets  
   nearly sorted data  
- Avoids repeated swaps and uses **shifting**, which reduces operations


##  When To Use Optimized Insertion Sort?

Use when:
- Input is almost sorted
- Memory usage must be minimal
- Simplicity matters

Avoid for:
- Very large datasets (due to quadratic time)
