# Stack Implementations

•This folder contains different stack implementations written in Java.These examples are created to understand how stacks work internally and how they can be built using different approaches.

•There are 2 files inside,

        ‣UnboundedArrayStack**
            A stack built using an array that grows when more space is needed
            The size adjusts automatically instead of having a fixed limit

        ‣StackUsingQueuesEnqueueFriendly**
            A stack created using two queues
            Pushing elements is simple
            Removing the top element takes a bit more work

## Why this exists
    To understand the LIFO (Last In First Out) concept
    To practice implementing stacks without using built in stack logic
    For learning and assignment purposes
