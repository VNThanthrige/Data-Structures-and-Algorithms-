# Binary Search Tree (BST)

This repository contains an implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Java.  
A BST is a hierarchical data structure that maintains elements in a sorted order, allowing efficient searching, insertion, and traversal operations.


## Properties

Every node in a BST follows these properties:

1. The **left subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than the node’s key**.  
2. The **right subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than the node’s key**.  
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be BSTs (recursive property).  
4. No duplicate nodes are allowed (optional based on implementation).  

These properties ensure that **in order traversal** always produces a sorted sequence.


## How It Works

Insertion works recursively:

1. Compare the new value with the current node.
2. If smaller, move to the left subtree; if larger, move to the right subtree.
3. Insert the value at the first null child encountered.

## Characteristics

✔ Hierarchical, node based structure  
✔ Maintains sorted ordering of elements  
✔ Supports recursive insertion and traversal  
✔ Simple pointer-based implementation  
✔ Traversals include in order, pre order, and post order

## When to Use BSTs

Use when:

✔ Sorted ordering is important  
✔ Frequent search and insert operations are required  
✔ Tree height is expected to be reasonably balanced  

Avoid when:

✔ Guaranteed balancing is required → consider **AVL Tree** 
✔ Fast lookups without ordering are needed → consider **HashMap** or **HashSet**
