### Array Circular Queue
A queue implemented using a fixed size circular array.

Instead of shifting elements, the queue wraps around the array using modular arithmetic.  
This ensures **optimal space utilization** and constant time operations.

**Key Concepts**
- Circular indexing
- Efficient memory usage
- Front and rear pointer management

**Common Use Cases**
- CPU scheduling
- Buffers and streaming systems
- Embedded and low level systems
