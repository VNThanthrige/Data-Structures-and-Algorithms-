# Bubble Sort (Java)

•This repository contains a simple implementation of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm in Java.  
•Bubble Sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.  
•After each full pass, the largest remaining element "bubbles" to its correct position at the end of the array.

## How It Works

The algorithm performs:
    ‣ Nested loops
    ‣ Adjacent comparisons
    ‣ In place element swapping
    ‣ Multiple passes until the array is sorted


##  Characteristics

    ‣ Stable sorting algorithm (maintains relative order of equal elements)
    ‣ In place (requires no extra storage)
    ‣ Simple, but inefficient for large lists


##  When to Use Bubble Sort?

    Use when:
        ‣ Teaching basic sorting concepts
        ‣ Dealing with very small datasets
        ‣ Visualization and algorithm demonstrations

    Avoid for:
        ‣ Large datasets
        ‣ Performance critical applications
