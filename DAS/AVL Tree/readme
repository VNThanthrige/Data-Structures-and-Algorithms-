# AVL Tree 

This repository contains an implementation of an AVL Tree in Java.
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) that maintains guaranteed O(log n) search, insert, and delete performance through automatic tree rotations.


##  How It Works

The AVL Tree maintains balance using the balance factor of each node:
- Balance Factor = height(left) − height(right) must always be −1, 0, or +1

Whenever this constraint is violated, the tree restores balance using structured rotations.

1. LL (Right Rotation)
2. RR (Left Rotation)
3. LR (Left Right Rotation)
4. RL (Right Left Rotation)

These rotations restore balance while preserving BST ordering.

## Characteristics

✔ Self balancing binary search tree
✔ Guaranteed logarithmic height
✔ Improved lookup performance over unbalanced BST
✔ Uses rotations to maintain balance
✔ Predictable worst-case complexity for operations

##  When to Use Merge Sort?

Use when -

✔ Fast lookups are required
✔ Data is inserted dynamically over time
✔ Worst case performance matters

Avoid when:

✔ Insert or delete operations are extremely frequent and a Red Black Tree is more efficient
✔ Key ordering is not needed (a HashMap may be better)
